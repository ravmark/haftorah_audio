<span class="title">Setting up your website template:<BR></span>


<br>

<span class="title">Step 1:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT FLASH ANIMATION:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_flash_details.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
Open the "flash.txt" file with Notepad and change "Yourwebsitetitle.com" to match your name or company name. Be sure not to delete the "logo=". Also change the "&slogan=An optional slogan or phrase can go in this area..." to match your slogan. Be sure not to delete the "&slogan=". This will change the Flash logo on all pages. If you wish to use a graphic logo, there are instructions later in this document.

<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 2:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT COPYRIGHT:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_js_files.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
Open the "copyright.js" in Notepad or any text editor file and change the "Your Company" and "info@yourdomain.com" lines to match your information. This will change the lower page info on all pages.

<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 3:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT CONTACT INFO:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_js_files.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
Open the "contact.js" in Notepad or any text editor file and change the company name, address, phone number and e-mail address. This will change contact info on the contact page.

<br><br>



<span class="title">Step 4:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT PAGES:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_HTML_software.htm">Software choices</a> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_edit_in_notepad.htm">Notepad Editing</a><br>
Change the text on all pages to match your information. You can use Microsoft Frontpage or a text editor like notepad. Take care not to delete any of the HTML tags that surround the text.

<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 5:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT THE CONTACT FORM:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_contact_form.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
If you are setup with an AllWebCo hosting account. Go to your control panel at "http://your-domain.com/cgi-bin/plusmail" and install the free script "Formail" then edit the contact page and replace "your-domain.com" with your domain.<BR><BR>

If you are not set up with AllWebCo hosting or do not have "Formail" installed. You can either setup the contact form to use another contact script, install "Formail" on your server or you can remove the contact form from the pages between the comment tags.<BR><BR>


If you wish to change the sizes of the form elements you can open the "style.css" and change the ".shadeform" ".textarea" and ".dropdown" width numbers.

<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 6:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT TITLES, DESCRIPTIONS AND KEYWORDS:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_page_titles.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
Open each of the HTML pages and change the titles (at the very top of the page) and also the description and the keywords to match your product or service. You can edit one page and copy and paste to the other pages. Be careful to only change what's inside the "" so you don't disturb the html code.

<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 7:<BR></span>
<b>UPLOAD:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_FTP.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
Upload the pages on to your hosting company's server using ftp software like <a href="http://cuteftp.com/" class="link">CuteFTP</a> or <a href="http://www.tucows.com/preview/195147.html" class="link">Coffee Cup</a> (free) or your control panel. Be sure to make a directory called picts on your server and put the pictures into that directory.



<br><br><br><br>


<span class="title">Options:<BR></span>

<BR>

<b>FONTS:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_font_colors.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
You can change your font colors and sizes by editing the "style.css" with a text editor. <a href="http://allwebco.com/colors.html" class="link">You can find other font colors by clicking here</a>. You can also change the font sizes in the "style.css" file. Change the "TABLE" px size to change the font colors or sizes on all pages. Change the "title" px size to change all the title sizes.

<br><br>

<b>MENU LINKS:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_menu_editing.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
You can change the names of the links like "About Us" or "What's New" to other page names by editing the "menu.js". Only change the one instance of the name and not the name with the ".htm" after it. Whatever you change in the menu.js will change every page on the website. Keep the names short so they don't go outside the menu. You can even add more pages but copying one link in the menu.js and pasting it right below the next. Be sure to back up your file before you edit them.

<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> If you use a ' in a .js file add a slash before it like this \'.


<br><br>

<b>USING A GRAPHIC LOGO:</b><br>
You can replace the text logo with a graphic one. To do this, delete or rename the header.js, then rename the "graphic_logo-header.js" to "header.js". In the picts directory you will find a graphic called "logo.jpg", open this graphic and edit it with your logo. The size should remain 100 pixels high if possible. It is recommended that you do not exceed 150 pixels in height or 750 pixels in width with your logo.

<br><br>

<b>PICTURES:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_pictures_change.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
You can replace the pictures with your own. The template pictures are now 125 pixels wide (100 pixels wide on the products page) but you can use any size picture you want if you edit the height and width numbers on the HTML pages. It's best not to go wider than 125 pixels if you can. Each page has it's own pictures which are named according to the page they are on. You will find all pictures in the "picts" folder.


<br><br>

<b>ADDING PAGES:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_add_remove_pages.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
You can add pages to your website by copying and pasting any one of the pages and renaming it to whatever you need. You can then add links from the other pages or even add the page to the menu by opening the menu.js and copying and pasting one of the links below another. Be sure to back up your files before you edit them.


<br><br>

<b><span class="title">PAYPAL SETUP</span><br>
SETTING UP ITEMS FOR PURCHASING:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_paypal.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
This template includes single order payment links so visitors can purchase your products on-line. Forms have been created in the "products.htm" page so it's easier to setup. This setup is for single item ordering and not setup as a shopping cart. You can convert this to a cart if you would like. You will find button generators and video tutorials at <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">Paypal</a> to help you generate this extra code to use on the template pages.


<br>

<blockquote>

<b>STEP 1:</b> Set up a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/mrb/pal=54WDFXDYG6TB6">Paypal merchant account</a> and get the payment e-mail address you need to setup purchases from your site. <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_paypal.htm">Click for more details</a><br>


<br>

<b>STEP 2:</b> Edit the "products.htm" and replace the "form" info with your new Paypal "form" info. There is a <a href="thanks-payment.htm">thank you page</a> included. When you setup the forms the thank you page is included in the code.<br>

<br>

<b>NOTE:</b> You can create a PayPal shopping cart with your pages so visitors can make multiple purchases. There is help and videos at paypal to help you with this type of setup.<br>
